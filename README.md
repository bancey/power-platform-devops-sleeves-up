Content presented during the sleeves up session can be found in this repo. 

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft 365 Tenant
  - a developer/test tenant works well, has to be used within 90 days or it will get removed. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-get-started#configurable-sandbox
- At least 3 Power Platform environments (can be created in the Power Platform Admin Center as "Developer" environments by creating 3 users in your M365 tenant)
  - A development environment
  - A test environment
  - A production environment
- An Azure DevOps organisation (free for up to 5 users)
  - Install the Power Platform build tools extension
  - Setup a service connection to your Power Platform environments
- A Git Repository, I'll be using both Azure DevOps and GitHub. (although if you're looking at this you likely already have one).
